data normalization or standarization techninques : is to put you data in a specific ormat to be the input of ur model

fist model you can build with keras is : 
sequential model : linear stack of layers 
the input data is the input layer (1st layer) but we do not define it using keras
we define the hidden layers -> the first hidden layer is actually the second layer of the model
units = nodes = neurons
last hidden layer = output layer that has units=nbr of classes
model.compile prepares the model for training
